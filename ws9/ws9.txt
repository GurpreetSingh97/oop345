 Compound types are types that a programmer constructs from a language's
 fundamental types and/or other compound types.  In C++11, compound types 
 include pointers and references to existing types, enumerations of named 
 constant values, arrays of objects of an existing type, classes and function
 types.  C++11 clarified the difference between lvalues and rvalues and 
 references to each, which helped simplify many of the facilities available
 in the standard library.

 This chapter describes the non-function types in detail.  The description 
 includes a review of one-dimensional arrays in both static and dynamic memory
 and shows how to allocate multi-dimensional arrays in both static and dynamic
 memory.  The description of classes reviews class definitions, introduces
 move-constructors and move-assignment operators and includes declarations of
 special members such as bit fields, class variables and class functions.
